Description: The DEtime package implements a toolkit for identifying the perturbation time point for two time series profiles obtained under control and perturbed conditions. It applies a Gaussian Process Regression model to the dataset and derives the full posterior distribution of the proposed perturbation time points. See DEtime_vignettes.pdf for more details.
