#' Inferring the perturbation time from biological time course data
#'
#' This package implements the Gaussian regression framework for perturbation time point inferrence in a two sample case. The package contains two main functions: DEtime_infer and DEtime_rank. DEtime_infer is the main function for perturbation point inference and DEtime_rank is used to filter out these silent genes before any focused perturbation point inference work. The package works on the time course data from a wild-type and a perturbed system. Acting upon pre-defined testing perturbation time, the function goes over these perturbation time candidates and derives their likelihoods. From Bayes' theory, under a uniform prior assumption, the posterior distribution of the tested perturbation time is derived from their corresponding likeliooods. Maximum a posterior (MAP), mean or median of the posterior distribution can be taken as the solution to the estimated perturbation time point.
