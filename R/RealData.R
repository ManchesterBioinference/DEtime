#' Experimental time-series data used for testing
#'
#' In this experiment, the aim is to study the transcriptional change occuring in Arabidopsis following inoculation with P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (PtoDC3000) versus the disarmed strain Pto DC3000hrpA. Two time series data are included: infection of Arabidopsis with virulent Pseudomonas syringage pv. tomato DC3000, which leads to disease developmen (perturbed condition 1) and infection of Arabidopsis with the disarmed strain DC3000hrpA (perturbed condition 2).
